Blerg... an Ember Data Blog example
================

Recently, I had to learn Ember.js to work on a project for my employer. Given the lack of good tutorials / examples which conform to the latest Ember Data specs, I decided to create this project to both learn Ember and share my findings with anyone who is interested. Hopefully, you'll find it useful. This is still very much a work in progress.

I built a pretty ghetto PHP-based backend for this project which, let's be honest, is kind of terrible. I'm sorry... but, obviously, the real action is on the frontend for this project. Many thanks to [Ian Selby](http://www.gen-x-design.com/archives/create-a-rest-api-with-php/) for the basic
REST api, which I then mangled to get the backend working.

A couple of things to note:
* I should have a live demo up shortly...
* You can go to /#newstory to create a new story
* The SQL to create the appropriate backend db lives at blergs.sql
* You'll also need to edit the config.php to make it hit the db

If you need something, drop me an email to jon -at- jon roig dot com.
