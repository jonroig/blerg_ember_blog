Blerg... an Ember Data Blog example
================

Recently, I had to learn Ember.js to work on a project for my employer. Given the lack of good tutorials / examples which conform to the latest Ember Data specs, I decided to create this project to both learn Ember and share my findings with anyone who is interested. Hopefully, you'll find it useful. This is still very much a work in progress.
