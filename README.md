Blerg... an Ember Data Blog example
================

Recently, I had to learn Ember.js to work on a project for my employer. Given the lack of good tutorials / examples which conform to the latest Ember Data specs, I decided to create this project to both learn Ember and share my findings with anyone who is interested. Hopefully, you'll find it useful. This is still very much a work in progress.

I built a pretty ghetto PHP-based backend for this project which, let's be honest, is kind of terrible. I'm sorry... but, obviously, the real action is on the frontend for this project. Many thanks to (Ian Selby)[http://www.gen-x-design.com/archives/create-a-rest-api-with-php/] for the basic
REST api, which I then mangled to get the backend working.

If you need something, drop me an email to jonroig -at- gmail dot com.
